# PasswordGenerator
## A password generator with a graphical user interface.

This program generates passwords of length 8 to 18 according to your preference. The strength of the password grows with it's length, meaning 18
would be the strongest, and 8 would be the minimal requirement.
The algorithm is fully randomised and there is no recurring pattern in the process.

The code is available here on GitHub if you wish to look through it.

If you want to download the application and try it out use this link: https://www.mediafire.com/file/lck0mzh9y7br65r/PasswordGenerator.zip/file
You will need to unzip the folder and run the RUNME bat file. This only works on <b>Windows</b> and you will require to ensure your computer has the 
latest Java SE which is available here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html

This program can also run on Linux and Mac. Though it won't work with the RUNME bat file and will require a manual approach. Sorry for not
including an automated one for those systems.
